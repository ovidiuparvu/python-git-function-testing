You are a senior software engineer. You need to implement a python function that determines the git branch currently used in a directory. Write tests for this function. Think deeply before writing any code. Review every part, and don't hallucinate.

Use pytest for writing the tests.

Source files should go in an src directory. Test file should go in a tests directory.
